Yan Matrunchyk

Junior Web Developer


I'm so thrilled to introduce myself on this page I've created. My name is Yan, I was born in Minsk. 3 years ago I moved to Poland where I live now. I've already had some skills in foreign languages including English, Polish and French and some time ago I started to learn a new one - JavaScript. Actually, it is my first web page, so let's start this new chapter!
